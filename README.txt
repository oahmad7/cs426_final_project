Wizard's Last Stand is a tower defense game that aims to keep its players on their toes at all times. 
This means that we designed the mechanics of the game to ensure that the player always has some interesting choice to make given the information that they were presented and have tools at their disposal for how to react. 
For instance, the trap the lies near the castle gives the player an interesting choice about how to approach opening the castle door and whether or not they are impatient or ignore the warnings the game gives them is dependent on the player. 
A patient player can discover the real key and avoid fighting the blue shell monsters all together whereas a impatient player may simply bruteforce their way through the combat encounter and discover the real key later.
Our overall theme of the game is medival fantasy and that is apparent in the castle, mystical gems, wizards, and monsters. 
The gameplay reflects this theme by allowing the user to cast spells and explore the fantasy landscape. 

4/13
We made some modifications to the game design in this iteration of the game. For starters, we added alot audio to the game from enemy attack and walking sounds, to player movement sounds, to audio queues when tasks are completed and background audio. All of this was done to imporve the atmosphere of the game and give the player more feedback from the game so they are aware of the systems of the games at all times. Additionally, we made substatial changes to the UI by adding the controls permenantly on screen as well as an onscreen indicator for the type of spell the player is currently holding. This is done so that give the player up-to-date information and provide ease of learnability.
