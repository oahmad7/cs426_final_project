Wizard's Last Stand is a tower defense game that aims to keep its players on their toes at all times. 
This means that we designed the mechanic s of the game to ensure that the player always has some interesting choice to make given the information that they were presented and have tools at their disposal for how to react. 
For instance, the trap the lies near the castle gives the player an interesting choice about how to approach opening the castle door and whether or not they are impatient or ignore the warnings the game gives them is dependent on the player. 
A patient player can discover the real key and avoid fighting the blue shell monsters all together whereas a impatient player may simply bruteforce their way through the combat encounter and discover the real key later.
Our overall theme of the game is medival fantasy and that is apparent in the castle, mystical gems, wizards, and monsters. 
The gameplay reflects this theme by allowing the user to cast spells and explore the fantasy landscape.
